            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>After World War I and the collapse of Austro-Hungary, Croatia and Slovenes, which was renamed The Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 
               <time datetime="1929"> 1929. </time> Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent communist state consisting 
               of six socialist republics under the strong hand of Marshal Josip Broz, aka TITO. The Republic of Croatia declared independence 
               in 1991 after democratic elections. A year later, Croatia was admitted as a full member of the United Nations(UN). 
               In April 2009, the country was accepted as a NATO member. In July 2013, Croatia joined the European Union.

            <p>Croatia is a country in south-eastern Europe. It borders Slovenia and Hungary to the north, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the east. 
               To the west it has access to the Adriatic Sea. 
               Controls most land routes from Western Europe to Aegean Sea and Turkish Straits;
               most Adriatic Sea islands lie off the coast of Croatia - some 1,200 islands, islets, ridges, and rocks.

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p>Though still one of the wealthiest of the former Yugoslav republics, Croatia’s economy suffered badly during the 1991-95 war. 
               The country's output during that time collapsed, and Croatia missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed 
               the fall of the Berlin Wall. Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes began to improve with moderate but steady GDP growth 
               between 4% and 6%, led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. 
            </p>
         </section>
         <div>
            <p>The government has also sought to accelerate privatization of non-strategic assets with mixed success. 
               Croatia’s economic recovery is still somewhat fragile; Croatia’s largest private company narrowly avoided collapse in 2017, thanks to a capital 
               infusion from an American investor. Restructuring is ongoing, and projected to finish by mid-July 2018.
